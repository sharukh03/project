    <p><h5>Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, who attended former Minister P. Palaniappan’s family wedding in Dharmapuri district on Sunday (December 14, 2025), urged the DMK cadre to take the achievements of the Dravida model government to every household in the State and convert them into votes.</h5></p><br><br>
    <p>The Chief Minister said at the wedding that through the Vellum Tamil Pengal programme held in Chennai on Saturday (December 13), the Dravida model government has ensured that an additional 17 lakh women receive monthly assistance under the Kalaingar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme. If any eligible woman has not benefited, they should appeal for the assistance. The assistance provided under the scheme will increase. On the same day (Saturday), a Reserve Bank of India report said that Tamil Nadu recorded the highest GSDP growth in the country, the Chief Minister added.

    <p><h5>The pace duo of Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana struck early to leave South Africa reeling at 7 for 3 inside the first four overs, a setback from which the visitors never recovered</h5></p>
    <p>India's new-ball bowlers and his own team's failure to deal with the general challenge of higher dot balls in a low-scorer led to South Africa's loss in the third T20 International against India, visiting skipper Aiden Markram has said.</p>
    <p>The pace duo of Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana struck early to leave South Africa reeling at 7 for 3 inside the first four overs, a setback from which the visitors never recovered as they slumped to a seven-wicket loss after posting just 117. The result gave India a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.</p><br><br><br>
